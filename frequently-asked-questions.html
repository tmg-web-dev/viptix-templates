            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">How are my tickets shipped?</p>
            <p>All tickets shipped will be done so via email, mobile tickets or an express delivery service (i.e., Federal Express, UPS, Express Mail, messenger, etc.) and will require a signature. We use express delivery services requiring signature to ensure that your tickets arrive safely and that their location can be tracked at any time. All credit cards are charged upon confirmation/ finalization. It is your responsibility to track your package and to be available to accept the package. You agree to provide us with a secure delivery location and authorize someone at that address to act as your agent in your absence to accept delivery of the package. If you provide a delivery location other than your credit card billing location, you hereby specifically agree to be responsible for that delivery and the tickets once delivered to the address you specify. You agree not to dispute such charges. Your expected ticket arrival date is based on the actual date we ship the order.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">What are the shipping timeframes and what charges will I pay?</p>
            <p>Please note that some orders will require 1-2 days processing time. The delivery method of your order is from the day that we ship the order, not the day the order is placed. All delivery times are subject to availability in your delivery area. Any other special delivery requirements can be quoted as requested.</p>

If your tracking number is listed as “TBD”, we will send you the tracking number when your tickets are ready to ship; at that point you can track your order. If your tickets do not arrive when expected please contact our Customer Care Department.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">When can I expect delivery of my tickets?</p>
            <p>All delivery options are based upon the date the tickets ship, not the date you placed the order. If the event tickets for your order are not currently available, they will be shipped as soon as they are received by the listing seller. We'll send you an email, with a tracking number, when your order is ready to ship. Shipments via FedEx Standard delivery will be delivered approximately 2 business days (not including Saturday or Sunday) after your order is shipped. FedEx Overnight Delivery will be delivered the next business day after it ships. If we are unable to ship your tickets in time for this event, we will contact you to set up an alternate delivery method. Please note that some tickets require 1-2 days processing time. All event ticket order delivery times are subject to availability in your area.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">I purchased tickets from VIPTIX but cannot attend the event. What is your refund/return policy?</p>
            <p>There are no refunds, exchanges, or cancellations on any order once it is submitted to us. This policy is in place because when you purchase your tickets we secure and acquire those tickets for you and are not able to recover our costs. Please order tickets only after you are certain you want them. For information on how to resell tickets that you purchased from VIPTIX, please contact nick@VIPTIX.com or call us at (716) 847-8499.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">What if my event is cancelled?</p>
            <p>If an event is cancelled we will provide a full refund for the amount that you paid for the tickets. Refunds are not offered for cancellations due to an act of God (rainout, earthquake, flood, etc.) or if a show is cancelled and refunds are not offered by the box office. Any shipping charges are not refundable. TICKETS MUST BE RECEIVED BACK IN OUR OFFICE WITHIN 14 DAYS OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CANCELLATION. We suggest returning tickets via certified mail or using a carrier that can provide you with proof of delivery. Send tickets to: Cancelled Event (Invoice #_________), 505 Main Street Buffalo, NY 14203. In case of a rainout or strike for a sporting event, no refunds will be made. You must exchange the tickets at the ballpark for a seat to a future game that is still available. In all other instances mentioned above we will attempt in every case to obtain a refund from the original seller of the tickets; however, no refund or percentage of refund can be guaranteed.</p>

            <p>SPECIAL NOTE: Tickets for certain events, including, but not limited to Houston Rodeo, may include a musical performance as well as other attractions as part of your admission. If there is a change or cancellation to either the musical performance or any other additional attractions, your event ticket remains valid for entry and will not be refunded. Also, if your event ticket is for a sponsored concert series with multiple feature performers, and there is a partial cancellation or change in artists performing in that concert series, VIPTIX will not provide a refund.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">What if my event is postponed?</p>
            <p>If an event is postponed or rescheduled, the tickets will be honored for the rescheduled event date. New tickets will not need to be issued for most rescheduled events or postponements. As we are not able to recover our costs on the tickets that we acquired for you, we in turn are unable to offer customers refunds on postponed or rescheduled events.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">What if my tickets are lost or stolen?</p>
            <p>When you receive your tickets, keep them in a safe place. Unfortunately, tickets cannot be replaced if they are lost, stolen, or damaged. Please note that direct sunlight or heat can damage some tickets.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Will my seats be together?</p>
            <p>Yes, the tickets purchased in a single listing will be seated together, unless otherwise noted by the seller under “Notes.” Please review the ticket notes before making your final selection. The term piggy back refers to the same seats numbers but they are in two consecutive rows. Some venues will have even or odd numbered seats that are also consecutive.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Why are my tickets printed on a sheet of paper?</p>
            <p>These tickets showcase the newest form of tickets or e-tickets technology and are your actual tickets. They are valid and 100% legitimate. Each ticket features a unique bar code that is scanned at the gate of the venue, just like a hard ticket in which most customers are accustomed. Make sure you bring these tickets with you to the event as you will not be admitted without them. Simply present your ticket at the gate, the attendant will scan them, and you will be admitted. Do not copy your tickets as the venue will only allow one entry per unique bar code. Make sure you keep your ticket in a safe place and protect it as you would any other ticket.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Why does somebody else's name appear on my ticket? Did I receive the wrong tickets?</p>
            <p>These are your tickets. The name that appears may have been the original purchaser of the ticket. Tickets are transferable and these are now your tickets.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Can I put tickets on hold?</p>
            <p>The ticket-hold policy is set by each individual listing seller. Although we cannot guarantee that a particular seller will be willing to hold tickets, we will certainly ask them on your behalf. If we are able to have a seller hold tickets, they typically will allow an hour or two for you to make your final decision on whether or not to purchase the tickets.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Can I purchase a VIPTIX Gift Card?</p>
            <p>VIPTIX Gift Cards make great gifts. VIPTIX Gift Cards can be purchased for any event in denominations of $25, $50, $100, and $500. Visit our Gift Card order form page for further details.</p>

            <h2>Selling Tickets</h2>
            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">I have tickets to sell. Will VIPTIX buy them from me?</p>
            <p>To offer your tickets for sale, please click here to contact us. Provide all information required, including exact seat locations and your asking price. A VIPTIX representative will evaluate your offer and then contact you directly.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that VIPTIX will require positive identification on any tickets that they purchase from you. This will include a legible copy of your driver's license and a signed letter of agreement acknowledging that you are selling your tickets to VIPTIX. Details will be provided if and when a mutual agreement is reached.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Can I sell my tickets on consignment with VIPTIX?</p>
            <p>VIPTIX, accepts tickets to be sold on consignment. Tickets sold on consignment may create a higher dollar return than if your tickets are purchased outright by VIPTIX. However, please be aware that it is possible that your consignment tickets may go unsold.</p>
            <p>For tickets sold on consignment, 85% of the sale price is paid to the seller. Consignments are settled on a weekly basis, even if only some of the seller's tickets have been sold. The seller has the right to take his/her consignment tickets back at any time, in which event, the seller is responsible for shipping charges.</p>
            <p>All consignments must be approved by a VIPTIX representative before you send the actual tickets. VIPTIX will require positive identification on any tickets taken in on consignment. This will include a legible copy of your driver's license and a signed letter of agreement acknowledging that you are permitting VIPTIX to sell your tickets on consignment. Details will be provided if and when a mutual agreement is reached.</p>
            <p>If you would like to sell tickets on consignment through VIPTIX, please <a href="/contact-us.html" class="info-link">click here</a> to contact us.</p>
            <p>PLEASE NOTE: VIPTIX, like any business, buys tickets at a wholesale price and strives to sell them at a retail price. If you wish to sell your tickets and remove your financial risk, the outright price VIPTIX will pay for tickets generally is between 50% and 75% of the asking retail price. If the market demand for your tickets is low or if VIPTIX already has sufficient tickets for that particular event, they may not be interested in purchasing your tickets, even if they are below face value.</p>

            <h2>Ticket Brokers</h2>
            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">What is a ticket broker?</p>
            <p>VIPTIX permits a number of professional ticket sellers to list their inventories on our site. Among our thoroughly screened listing sellers are reputable ticket brokers. A broker is defined as "One hired for a fee to negotiate purchases, contracts, or sales." A ticket broker does just that. There are people who want to sell their tickets and there are also people who want to buy those same tickets. There are two ways that a broker can do this. The broker can buy the tickets outright from the seller and hope that they can sell them. If the market drops or the tickets don't get sold the broker incurs the loss. The second way is the broker could take the tickets from the seller on consignment and keep a fee if they are sold. Either way a ticket broker puts the buyers and the sellers together for a fee.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Why are the tickets on your site listed above face value?</p>
            <p>Licensed ticket brokers generally sell their tickets at prices above face value. This price is known as the ticket's "market value." The only place you can purchase tickets at face value is through Ticketmaster or a venue box office. However, it is important to note that these primary sellers often charge additional service fees—creating actual prices that are higher than the amount listed on the face of the ticket.</p>
            <p>Licensed ticket brokers specialize in obtaining desirable seats for high-demand and sold-out events. They get these tickets from a variety of sources including season ticket holders and individuals who have extra tickets for events. To obtain these high-demand tickets, brokers pay a premium, or a price often well above face value. They then sell these tickets at market value. The market value price for a ticket is determined by many factors including seat location, supply and demand, date and location of event, etc.</p>
            <p>Our ultimate goal is to provide our customers with the greatest selection of event tickets at competitive prices.</p>

            <p class="info-bold no-margin-bottom">Is it illegal to sell tickets for more than face value?</p>
            <p>No. It does generally require a license and set of standards to follow. In New York, where VIPTIX is licensed, it also requires a $100,000 cash bond for consumer protection to be held either privately or through an association. We are licensed to sell in 98% of the markets and will notify you if we cannot. All transactions that we handle meet all state and local provisions.</p>
