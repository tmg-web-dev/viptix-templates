            <h2>VIPTIX was born to help fans buy and sell event tickets.</h2>
            <p>There was a time in the 1980's when Nick Giammusso our company President & CEO ran a traditional venue box office at 'The Memorial Auditorium' in our hometown of Buffalo, NY for his Godparents and concert promoters Irwin & Monique Pate. He essentially reported to the artist's manager and the ultimate goal was to get people in the seats and distribute event tickets so the artist was happy.</p>

            <p>At an early age, Nick realized that aha moment in the ticket industry while helping frustrated fans buy and sell event tickets out of "The Aud" box office. The phone would ring with eager clients looking to buy tickets to an already sold-out event. The next call was someone who had extra seats they wanted to return for a refund. Standard policy at the box office was (and still is today)- NO refunds or exchanges! So Nick would take phone numbers and match-up fans to help one buy, and the other sell their tickets.</p>

            <p>In 1993, Nick launched out on his own to start VIPTIX from the basement of his parents home. The business was born and thrived as a ticket company that helped the average fan buy and sell event tickets! VIPTIX was started with small 2-3 line classified newspaper ads and eventually evolved and blossomed into one of the first online secondary ticket marketplaces in the world.</p>
