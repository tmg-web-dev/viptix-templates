            <p>At VIPTix.com our goal is to make your use of this site and purchasing experience as easy and efficient as possible, so that you are quickly on your way to enjoying your event. The following Policies and Terms of Use ("Terms") are designed to ensure your understanding of the use of this site and purchase process at Primo Experiences, Inc. d/b/a VIPTix.com ("VIP TIX"). The Terms govern your use of VIP TIX and your purchase of any ticket from this site. By using or visiting this site, or purchasing tickets, you expressly agree to abide and be bound by and follow these Terms as well as all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations. You represent that you are legally able to enter into a binding contract. If you are under the age of 18, you may only use this site in conjunction with and under the supervision of a parent or guardian. The Terms include the following provisions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All orders placed on VIPTix.com are considered requests until the respective seller confirms availability of the tickets, at which time our buyer guarantee takes effect.</li>
                <li>All sales are final; there are no cancellations, returns, or exchanges.</li>
                <li>If an event is cancelled you will be given a full refund less shipping charges. If an event is postponed or rescheduled your order will not qualify for a refund.</li>
                <li>Ticket prices may be above the "face value" listed on the ticket (they may also be below the "face value").</li>
                <li>Confirmed orders may be filled with comparable or upgraded tickets if the original tickets are no longer available.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Processing:</h2>
            <p>You understand and agree that VIP TIX is acting only as a ticket marketplace. It is an intermediary between ticket buyers and ticket sellers. Through this website, VIP TIX provides a service that allows visitors who want to buy tickets to find those tickets. If a buyer finds desirable tickets, buyer places an offer to purchase the tickets by placing an order. The buyer does so by completing the information requested. Once the buyer submits the order it is final and the buyer cannot cancel or retract the order. However, placing an order does not complete the sale. Rather, the order will be subject to acceptance and notification to you that delivery of the ticket has been confirmed by the respective seller. At that point, your credit or debit card used in placing the order will be charged and VIP TIX's consumer protection measures take affect. VIP TIX will reserve the funds on your account when your order is placed, however the funds are not captured until after the order is confirmed. Please note that the price you pay may be substantially higher than the face value of the tickets you purchase.</p>

            <h2>Ticket Purchase Policy:</h2>
            <p>The purchase price contains a service charge which has been added to the price determined by the seller of the tickets. All orders are subject to ticket availability. VIP TIX agrees to use its best efforts to procure and to deliver, prior to the date of the event, the tickets described. VIP TIX also reserves the right to replace tickets with comparable or upgraded tickets if originally ordered tickets are no longer available. Definitions of "comparable" and "upgraded" are made at the reasonable discretion of VIP TIX. Should VIP TIX fail to deliver any ticket contracted for, VIP TIX's sole obligation or liability shall be limited to the return to buyer any payments made by buyer to VIP TIX under this Agreement. VIP TIX reserves the right to cancel and refund the buyer's order at any time for any reason. Due to the large volume of ticket sellers listing tickets on our site, on very rare occasions, pricing errors do occur. Because VIP TIX acts as an intermediary between the original purchaser of the tickets and the end user of the tickets, VIP TIX shall not be liable for any pricing errors listed on this site. Furthermore, VIP TIX does not guarantee any information provided by our licensed sellers in the 'Seller Notes' area of the ticket listings. Due to the large volume of ticket sellers listing tickets on our site, locations, descriptions and pricing of similar or equal tickets may vary. It will be the buyer's responsibility to verify any possible inconsistency or discrepancy in the ticket location, description and/or price by calling VIP TIX at 888-VIP-TIXX before the order is placed.</p>

            <h2>Refund Policy:</h2>
            <p>All sales are final. A full refund of the purchase price, excluding shipping charges, will be given for cancelled events. To qualify for a refund, the buyer must return their tickets to VIP TIX within 2 weeks of notice from VIP TIX offering the buyer the opportunity to return their tickets. No refunds will be given without the original tickets, unless otherwise determined by VIP TIX in its sole discretion. Postponed or rescheduled events will not be refunded. VIP TIX, in its sole discretion, will determine when an event is cancelled. Event date, times, venue and subject matter may change. We are not always notified if a show is postponed, rescheduled or cancelled. It will be the buyer's responsibility to monitor the event and to confirm any changes to the event with the entity putting on the event. In certain instances, a venue, promoter, or any entity putting on the event will require a ticket holder to relocate his or her seat. VIP TIX shall not be held responsible for any such change and will not be obligated to provide a refund or any other compensation.</p>

            <h2>Denial of Admission:</h2>
            <p>A buyer that has difficulty getting into an event is required to contact us at 888-VIP-TIXX immediately for assistance. If the problem is not resolved, and the buyer is denied admission, it is the buyer's responsibility to obtain proof from the venue that they were denied entry. VIP TIX will provide the buyer with a pre-paid shipping label to use in returning the tickets and proof of denied entry provided by the venue. Upon receipt of the invalid tickets and confirmation of the proof provided that the tickets were indeed invalid, or if VIP TIX otherwise determines in its sole discretion that the ticket was invalid, the buyer, as the sole remedy, will receive a full refund of the cost of the ticket including all fees and shipping charges.</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2>
            <p>VIP TIX uses your information only as described in VIP TIX' Privacy Policy also found on this site. <a href="/privacy-policy.html" class="info-link">View Privacy Policy</a></p>

            <h2>Delivery of Tickets:</h2>
            <p>In most cases, tickets will be delivered by the method and timeframe designated in the ticket listing. For listings with no designated delivery method, tickets will typically be shipped via our preferred carrier, FedEx. However, in all cases, VIP TIX reserves the right to deliver tickets for any order as late as one (1) hour prior to the event. Valid delivery services on the day of the event may include, in VIP TIX' sole discretion, Will Call at the venue box office, email (when applicable), via courier or pick up at a location outside the venue designated by VIP TIX. Certain delivery designations, such as "e-Tickets" or "Instant Download", do not constitute guarantees of delivery any sooner than the day of the event. Typically such tickets will be delivered as designated, however in some cases delivery may first require additional verification or be subject to delays on behalf of the seller. It is the buyer's sole responsibility to contact VIP TIX if they do not receive tickets within 48 hours of the event. Failure to do so will disqualify the buyer from receiving a refund for any ticket the buyer claims was not delivered, unless failure to notice is waived by VIP TIX, in its sole discretion. Photo ID may be required to accept delivery.</p>

            <h2>Lost, Stolen, or Damaged Tickets</h2>
            <p>Please keep your tickets in a safe place. VIP TIX is not responsible for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. Please note that direct sunlight or heat can damage certain types of tickets.</p>

            <h2>Payment Options:</h2>
            <p>As a buyer, you grant VIP TIX permission to charge your credit or debit card for the purchase of tickets. We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, American Express and PayPal. For other payment methods, please contact us at 888-VIP-TIXX.</p>

            <h2>Ticket Holder Behavior Policy:</h2>
            <p>You agree to abide by all rules and policies of the venue, promoter and anyone else responsible for putting on the event. Should you or the person using the ticket you purchased fail to abide by those rules and policies, you shall be subject to all applicable fines and legal or other expenses associated therewith. Further, should any violation result in the loss of the ticket seller's season ticket rights or right to use any other tickets at that venue, or the right to purchase other tickets from that venue, you shall be held liable for all reasonable costs, expenses and losses associated with said loss including, but not limited to, all direct, indirect, vicarious, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages, including lost profits.</p>

            <h2>Non-Affiliations:</h2>
            <p>VIP TIX is in no way affiliated with any venue, promoter, team, league or organizing group and is not associated with any official organizer of the events for which it list tickets.</p>

            <h2>Changes in Terms and Conditions:</h2>
            <p>VIP TIX reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change these Terms at any time. If VIP TIX changes any term or condition, said modification, revision and additional information shall be posted here and shall automatically replace the terms and conditions and become binding on all users of this site. Your continued use of the site following VIP TIX's posting of revised terms and conditions constitute your acceptance of the revised agreement.</p>

            <h2>Unlawful Activity:</h2>

            <p>A user who is the subject of a complaint or whom VIP TIX believes may have violated these Terms or applicable law will be subject to investigation by VIP TIX. User agrees to cooperate fully in such investigation including, but not limited to, providing any and all information demanded by VIP TIX. VIP TIX reserves the right to take any action without prior notice it deems appropriate in its sole discretion including, but not limited to, canceling orders, issuing a warning, suspending or terminating service, denying access, canceling transactions, refusing to honor pending or future transactions, remove material, or exercise any other remedy available to it (including civil, criminal or injunctive redress) if VIP TIX finds, in its sole discretion, a user: (a) is unwilling to be cooperative with any investigation; (b) has engaged in any illegal, unlawful or fraudulent act or otherwise violated these Terms or applicable law or has acted in concert with anyone so engaged; or (c) has provided information that VIP TIX is unable to authenticate or verify.
